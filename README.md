# Puppet Pipeline
## Test
## Testing project will utilize basic mean stack, and amazon aws ec2 servers being fed from puppet pipeline and testing all unit / e2e before dedicated build. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.2.

This project is a testing ground for puppet pipeling utilizing a basic mean stack and e2e testing

## Development server

Mean stack will launch node on bin/www. To start localhost development run 'npm start' This will compile the Angular code and the API. Frontend will be accessible at localhost:3000, API will be visible at localhost:3000/api


## Build

Run 'npm start' to trigger build process. Start now has build process built in pointing at bin/www

## Running unit tests

All unit tests are build utilizing Karma.
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests locally via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## To Do

All e2e and unit testing still needs to be implemented
Run e2e and unit testing against puppet pipeline and aws
